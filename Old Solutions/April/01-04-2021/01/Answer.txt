CBLOCK defines a block of constants.

Syntax:

cblock [expr]
 label[:increment][,label[:increment]]
endc

CBLOCK defines a list of named sequential symbols. The purpose of this directive is to assign address offsets to many labels.
The list of names ends when an ENDC directive is encountered.
EXPR indicates the starting value for the first name in the block.
Multiple names may be given on a line, separated by commas.
By default the values are increment by one if not specified.
Solution:

Using above definition,

CBLOCK 0x29
    V1, V2, V3, V4, V5
ENDC

V1 = 29
V2 = 30
V3 = 31
V4 = 32
V5 = 33
